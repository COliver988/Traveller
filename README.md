Traveller Trade

Various Traveller software.  
Traveller 2 was created in Winforms.  
Traveller 3 will redo that in UWP and try to modernize a bit.
Traveller 4: UWP with mySQL for backend. Replaces v3.
Traveller Tracker: UWP with SQLite for backend and Entity Framework. Basically starting over - the v4 was trying MVVM and failing horribly.
Ship Tracker - see my blog [Traveller blog](https://traveller-ct.blogspot.com/)

## Current Attempt
TrackerCore - using .NET Core as replacing my computer, despite source control, had issues with the packages. And I can release this as a single .exe file. In theory.
