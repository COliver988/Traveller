And there will be issues...

# screen shots are good
# instructions of how you got the issue are necessary to track it down
# is this a fatal issue - the program just dies?
# is this a cosmetic issue - something is spelled wrong?
# is this a feature request - you would like the program to be able to do something differently or a new feature?

And as per the other guides, please be nice.
